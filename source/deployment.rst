Deployment

Docker
-----------

`Docker <https://www.docker.com/what-docker>`_ is an open-source tool for creating, deploying, and running applications by using containers.
 Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

By using containers, the application will run on any machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

.. its dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together as a container image.

Containerization is an approach in which an application or service, its dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together as a container image.

 The containerized application can be tested as a unit and deployed as a container image instance to the host operating system (OS).



Docker is an open-source tool for automating the deployment of applications.




Fabric
----------

`Fabric <http://www.fabfile.org/>`_ is a high level Python (2.7, 3.4+) library designed to execute shell commands remotely over SSH for application deployment.

It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting execution.

    We can execute shell commands over SSH, so we only need to have SSH running on
    the remote machine. It interact with the remote machines that we specify as if
    they were local. 


Ansible
---------

`Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_  is an automation tool to deploy our applications. It gives us the power to deploy multi-tier applications reliably and consistently, all from one common framework. 

Ansible is a configuration management and provisioning tool used to automate deployment tasks over SSH.

Ansible helps to automate :

+ **Application deployment**: Make DevOps easier by automating the deployment of internally developed applications to our production systems.
+ **Configuration management**: Change the configuration of an application, OS, or device; start and stop services; install or update applications; implement a security policy; or perform a wide variety of other configuration tasks.
+ Set up the various servers needed in our infrastructure.


.. We can configure needed services as well as push application artifacts from one common system.



Google Cloud Platform
-------------------------
`Google Cloud Platform(GCP) <https://cloud.google.com/>`_ is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google.
 
 The platform includes a range of hosted services for compute, storage, application development and deployment a that run on Google hardware. 

Google Cloud Platform(GCP) offers services for compute, storage, networking, big data, machine learning and the internet of things (IoT)
, as well as cloud management, security and developer tools.

Amazon Web Services
-----------------------

`AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_ is a cloud platform service from amazon, used to create and deploy any type of application in the cloud.

 AWS is a Cloud platform service offering compute power, data storage, and a wide array of other IT solutions and utilities for modern organizations. AWS was launched in 2006, and has since become one of the most popular cloud platforms currently available.

It offers many featured services for compute, storage, networking, analytics, application services, deployment, identity and access management, directory services, security and many more cloud services.
