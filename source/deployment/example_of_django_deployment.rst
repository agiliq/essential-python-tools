`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_  is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. Django has a lot of inbuilt set of components that helps you to develop websites faster and easier.

`Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org/>`_   is  a simple, light-weight Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.  `WSGI <http://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_  is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request.

`Nginx <https://www.nginx.com/>`_ is a high-performance HTTP server, reverse proxy, load balancer and static files loader.

`Supervisord <http://supervisord.org/>`_ is a process-control system which allows us to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX operating system.



<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


Let's start with our server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once we create our server and let's login to the server via SSH, 

.. code-block:: shell

    $ ssh root@IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER


Now we have to install the prerequisites, run these commands 


.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install git python-pip python-dev virtualenv virtualenvwrapper 
    $ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
    $ pip install --upgrade pip


Now letâ€™s `configure the virtual-env wrapper <https://books.agiliq.com/projects/essential-python-tools/en/latest/environment_management.html#virtualenvwrapper>`_

After setting-up the virtualenvwrapper, create a virtualenv

.. code-block:: shell

    $ mkvirtualenv env-name

From within our virtual-env, install:

.. code-block:: shell

    (env-name) $ pip install django gunicorn psycopg2


Let's clone the repo in home folder, pull the application from Git, we use this repo https://github.com/anmolakhilesh/django-polls-rest

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/anmolakhilesh/django-polls-rest
    
Now we have to add permissions to the :code:`manage.py`  file


.. code-block:: shell

    $ cd /django-polls-rest/
    $ chmod 755 manage.py 


Now install the requirements

.. code-block:: shell

    (env-name) $ pip install -r requirements.txt


Now set up PostgreSQL    

Create a file :code:`.env` and add these lines in that

.. code-block:: shell

        $ export POSTGRES_DB = pollsdb
        $ export POSTGRES_USER = polls_admin
        $ export POSTGRES_PASSWORD = polls_password
        $ export POLLSAPI_PG_HOST = 127.0.0.1


Create a postgres Database

.. code-block:: shell
    
    $ sudo -u postgres psql

After running the above command, we will be logged inside PostgreSQL terminal, now lets create our db and user

.. code-block:: shell

        > CREATE DATABASE pollsdb; 
        > CREATE USER polls_admin WITH PASSWORD 'polls_password'; 
        > ALTER ROLE polls_admin SET client_encoding TO 'utf8'; 
        > ALTER ROLE polls_admin SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed'; 
        > ALTER ROLE polls_admin SET timezone TO 'UTC'; 
        > ALTER USER polls_admin CREATEDB; 
        > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE pollsdb TO polls_admin;
        
        > \q   # to quit the shell


Make sure that these details match the details in the :code:`.env` file. Exit the PostgreSQL shell by typing :code:`\q` .


Now as the DB is ready , we can run migrations command inside the repo folder.


.. code-block:: shell

    # migrations
    (env-name) $ python manage.py migrate
    
    # Create a supervisor, let's  
    (env-name) $ python manage.py createsuperuser



Now postgres-db is setted, now we have to set up the server


<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


Using gunicorn 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: shell

    (env-name) $ pip install gunicorn

After installing gunicorn , now run it 

.. code-block:: shell

    # starts the server 
    (env-name) $ gunicorn polls_rest.wsgi

It will run the app , we can check  :code:`IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER:8000` , :code:`IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER:8000/admin` .
It will not have any css , as the gunicorn only serves the application. We will be serving static files using `nginx` .

To exit it press :code:`Ctrl+C` .

.. code-block:: shell    

    # starts the server by binding it to a specific port
    (env-name) $ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8888 polls_rest.wsgi

    # running with a config file
    (env-name) $ gunicorn -c /path/to/config/file polls_rest.wsgi

    # running in daemon mode
    (env-name) $ gunicorn --daemon polls_rest.wsgi


If it is in daemon-mode, then exit it with :code:`pkill gunicorn` , which will kill the gunicorn process.

To have a `gunicorn config file <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/configure.html#configuration-file>`_ for gunicorn , we write the config file in a :code:`.py` .




Using nginx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By using gunicorn, we were able to run the application, but without styles as the gunicorn only runs the application and does not serve the static files django does not serve static file except in development.

We will use :code:`nginx` to serve the static files , nginx will first get the request, and it will send it to gunicorn. 



To install nginx

.. code-block:: shell   

    $ sudo apt-get install nginx


.. Now we have to configure nginx to tell it what to do.

let's configure nginx

So, **create a file** :code:`/etc/nginx/sites-available/pollsapp` and add the following 

.. code-block:: shell   

    server {
        listen 80;   #L1
        server_name SERVER_DOMAIN_OR_IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER;   #L2

        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }   #L3

        location /static/ {                  #L4
                root /home/django-polls-rest;        
        }

        location / {                        #l5
                include proxy_params;
                proxy_pass http://unix:/home/django-polls-rest/polls_rest.sock;        
        }   
    }



+ #L1 and #L2 lines defines where our nginx server should run.
+ #L3 line ignores any errors related to the favicon.
+ #L4 block :code:`location /static/` defines the location of static files.
+ #L5 block :code:`location /` tells the socket(gunicorn socket) to communicate.

.. will have a standard URI prefix of :code:`static/` and should be looked for in :code:`~/django-polls-rest/static/` folder.


After this, we have to enable this config file by linking with the :code:`sites-enabled` folder.

.. code-block:: shell  

    $ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pollsapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled


.. The path :code:`/home/django-polls-rest` will be the application path.



We link the above file  to :code:`sites-enabled` , so that it will be included in the main nginx settings file :code:`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`


After enabling the config file , we can check nginx configuration by 

.. code-block:: shell  

    $ sudo nginx -t


If the configuration file is correct , then we should see this

.. image:: _static/images/nginx-t.png


Now we have to mention the static files directory of our app in :code:`settings.py`   file . So add this line in `settings.py`

.. code-block:: python  

    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/')


After adding this line, we have to perform run :code:`collectstatic` command 

.. code-block:: shell

    (env-name) $ python manage.py collectstatic
    

Let's run the app

.. code-block:: shell

    (env-name) $ gunicorn --daemon --workers 3 --bind  unix:/home/django-polls-rest/polls_rest.sock polls_rest.wsgi


The :code:`/home/django-polls-rest/polls_rest.sock` file is a unix-socket file which will be created automatically. 
And this file will enable Gunicorn and Nginx to communicate with each other.    
    

Now Restart Nginx for changes to take effect.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo service nginx restart

This will run our app in the :code:`http://IP_ADDRESS` 

 Point to remember , check :code:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` in  :code:`settings.py` to have you host name or ip address of server.

 
Configuring Gunicorn with Supervisord
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Supervisor <http://supervisord.org/>`_ is a process monitoring tool, which can restart any process if the process dies or gets killed for some reason.

At present we are manually starting gunicorn in daemon to run our app, Suppose if this gunicorn process closes or gets killed due to some reason then we have to manually start it again.
To monitor our processes we use `Supervisord`, So that supervisor controls the gunicorn process.

To install supervisord

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo apt-get install supervisor


Let's add a configuration file :code:`pollsapi.conf` for our application in :code:`/etc/supervisor/conf.d/` folder,
the :code:`conf.d` folder will have all our config files.


.. code-block:: shell

    [program:pollsapi]   #L1
    directory=/home/django-polls-rest/polls_rest     #L2
    command=/home/.virtualenvs/demo-polls-1/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:/home/django-polls-rest/polls_rest.sock polls_rest.wsgi      #L3
    autostart=true       #L4
    autorestart=true     #L5
    stderr_logfile=/var/log/pollsapi.err.log      #L6
    stdout_logfile=/var/log/pollsapi.out.log      #L7


Let's understand the config file we have written,

+ #L1 line :code:`[program:pollsapi]` names the program( or process ) as `pollsapi`, which can be used as

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo supervisorctl start pollsapi


+ #L2 line :code:`directory` is the path to our project.
+ #L3 line :code:`command` is the command to start our project
+ #L4 lines :code:`autostart` tells the script to start on system boot.
+ #L5 line :code:`autorestart` tells the script to restart when it closes for some reason
+ #L6 :code:`stderr_logfile` which will store the error logs &  #L7 :code:`stdout_logfile` will store the non-error logs.


Now lets save this file and update supervisor

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo supervisorctl reread
    $ sudo supervisorctl update
    $ sudo supervisorctl reload

Check the supervisor status .

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo supervisorctl status

This will show 

.. image:: _static/images/supervisor-status.png


To check gunicorn processes 
    
.. code-block:: shell    
    
    $ ps ax | grep gunicorn

This command lists all the processes running with gunicorn 


To check if the app is running , let's do curl

.. code-block:: shell  

    $ curl 0.0.0.0:8000

.. this will show if the app is running or not    

After configuring gunicorn with supervisor, let's restart our nginx 

.. code-block:: shell  

    $ systemctl restart nginx

Now our app should be running on :code:`http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER`
