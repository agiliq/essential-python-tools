[Google Cloud Platform(GCP)](https://console.cloud.google.com/) is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google.

The platform includes a range of hosted services for compute, storage and application development that run on Google hardware. 
Google Cloud Platform services can be accessed by software developers, cloud administrators and other enterprise IT professionals
