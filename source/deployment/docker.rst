Docker
-----------

`Docker <https://www.docker.com/what-docker>`_ is an open-source tool for creating, deploying, and running applications by using containers.
 Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

By using containers, the application will run on any machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

.. its dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together as a container image.

Containerization is an approach in which an application or service, its dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together as a container image.

 The containerized application can be tested as a unit and deployed as a container image instance to the host operating system (OS).

Docker is an open-source tool for automating the deployment of applications.
