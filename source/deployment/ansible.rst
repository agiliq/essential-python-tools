Ansible
---------

`Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_  is an automation tool to deploy our applications. It gives us the power to deploy multi-tier applications reliably and consistently, all from one common framework. 

Ansible is a configuration management and provisioning tool used to automate deployment tasks over SSH.

Ansible helps to automate :

+ **Application deployment**: Make DevOps easier by automating the deployment of internally developed applications to our production systems.
+ **Configuration management**: Change the configuration of an application, OS, or device; start and stop services; install or update applications; implement a security policy; or perform a wide variety of other configuration tasks.
+ Set up the various servers needed in our infrastructure.


.. We can configure needed services as well as push application artifacts from one common system.
